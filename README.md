Material of video PE #71: Improved Dynamic Model of Current-Mode-Controlled DC-DC Converters

Available at: https://youtu.be/rnLj38oNSFc

This video shows the derivation of an improved dynamic model of current-mode-controlled dc-dc converters. The model is based on the analysis of the current-mode modulator in the discrete domain. A continuous model is also derived. Qspice simulations are shown to verify the model.
